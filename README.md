# ML-Models-from-Scratch-and-Apps
create ML models from scratch for better understanding and to empower the knowledge of machine learning domain. 

## build popular ML models supervised and un supervised:

### 1. Supervided Models (Classification and Regression):
A. KNN (classification - clssify based on closest K points + Regression - Get the average).
B. Linear Regression (Regression).
C. Logistic Regression (Classifiction - 2 Classes).
D. Decision Trees
E. Random Forest
F. Naive Bayes
G. Perceptron
H. SVM

### 2. Unsupervided Models (Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction)
A. KMeans (clustering)
B.PCA ( Dimensionality Reduction).
