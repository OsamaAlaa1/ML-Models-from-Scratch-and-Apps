# ML-Models-from-Scratch-and-Apps
create ML models from scratch for better understanding and to empower the knowledge of machine learning domain. 

## build popular ML models supervised and un supervised:

### A. Supervided Models (Classification and Regression):
1. KNN (classification - clssify based on closest K points + Regression - Get the average).
2. Linear Regression (Regression).
3. Logistic Regression (Classifiction - 2 Classes).
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Naive Bayes
7. Perceptron
8. SVM

### B. Unsupervided Models (Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction)
1. KMeans (clustering).
2. DBSCAN (Hierarchical Clustering)
3. PCA ( Dimensionality Reduction).
4. Kernel PCA
5. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

### C. Anomaly Detection
Isolation Forest
### D. Association Rule Learning
